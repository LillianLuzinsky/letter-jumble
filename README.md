## Things I enjoyed

My niece loved the colours used and the hover effects<br>
The dark background prevents eye strain when using the app.<br>
My sister is currently using this app to play with my niece.<br>


## Challenges

1) I'm still learning how to develop in ReactJS. I tested a few React drag and drop
libraries, and react-sortable-hoc was the library I could understand to implement
in my project.
2) I tried not using a library for the spelling page, but unfortunately, 
you can't drag and drop on a mobile phone or tablet.
3) I'm still working on making it responsive for smaller devices.
4) Navigation bar is still a work in progress.

### Spent 2 weeks working from recieving brief until delivering presentation.
