# Letter-Jumble
Interactive learning game created for my 3 year old niece.
The main purpose of the app is to help parents teach the alphabet to their 
young children, while spending quality time together.

## How it works

Presently, the homepage only features 2 games, which are labelled: 'Jumble' and 'Spelling'.<br>
<br>
The 'Jumble' page has the entire alphabet displayed.<br>
Click on the 'Jumble' button and the alphabet will be shuffled in a random order.<br>
The parent then helps the child to drag and drop the alphabet back in the correct order.
<br><br>
The 'Spelling' page provides a random 3 letter word accompanied by an 
animated gif.<br>
Underneath is a set of unordered letters, which the child is now required
to drag and drop the correct letters to spell out the word provided.<br>
When successful, click on 'Next Word' button.

## Things I enjoyed

1) My niece loved the colours used and the hover effects<br><br>
2) The dark background prevents eye strain when using the app.<br><br>
3) My sister is currently using this app to play with my niece.
I'm proud to say that my 3 year old niece was able to learn the entire alphabet
in only 2 days thanks to these interactive games.<br>

## Challenges

1) I'm still learning how to develop in ReactJS. I tested a few React drag and drop
libraries, and react-sortable-hoc was the library I could understand to implement
in my project.<br><br>
2) I tried not to use a library for the spelling page, because I wanted to understand 
the algorithm. Unfortunately, you can't drag and drop on a mobile phone or tablet.<br><br>
3) I'm still working on making it responsive for smaller devices.<br><br>
4) Navigation bar is still a work in progress.<br><br>
5) I want to learn to add an animated feature where it rewards the child 
when the exercise is accurately completed.
